# Base theme.

- `src` you will find the source files for the theme.
  - do not include src source files in the theme.
- `dist` you will find the compiled CSS and JS.

 - `nodejs`
 - `bower`
 - `yarn` or `npm` 
 - `gulp`

then access `src/` and run:

`bower install`

`yarnpkg install` or `npm install`

then just run the command: `gulp` to compile the stylesheets.

the compiled CSS will be placed in the `dist` folder.
